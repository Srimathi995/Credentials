AccessPrivilege:
he access privilege object allows you to assign which user groups have permission to perform certain transactions. An access privilege object contains the following two lists of application-defined user groups:
Performers: users who are authorized to perform the transaction (e.g., creating, updating, and deleting an object).
Second Signers: users who can verify an action taken by another user or provide further authentication. A single user cannot be both the Performer and Second Signer for the same transaction.
Access privilege objects do not have Check In, Check Out, or Undo Check Out capabilities.
The following access privilege objects are included with Plant Operations by default:
FSMConfigurationDesigner: allows you save any changes made in the FSM tab in Process Designer. This privilege is required to establish relationships between classes and flexible state models.
OpenCloseForm: allows you to open and close a form in Shop Operations.
PDCreate: allows you to create and save Process Designer objects.
PDDelete: allows you to delete Process Designer objects.
PDUDADesigner: allows you to create and modify a Process Designer UDADefinition object.
PDUpdate: allows you to update and save Process Designer objects.
ProcessDesigner: allows you to log into Process Designer.
ProcessModeler: allows you log into Process Designer but you have no access to forms, subroutines, or event sheets.
RuntimeOptions: allows you to change stations, change the locale, and disable auto timeout and time scripts in Shop Operations.
ShopOperations: allows you to perform operator runtime transactions.
UserAuthentication: allows you to call the middleware method to authenticate the user when logging into Shop Operations Server.
